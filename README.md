Capstone Project for Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certification Program

## Introduction

TikTok is a short-form video-sharing platform that empowers users ( aka "influencers") to create, discover, and share engaging content across diverse genres, with the primary purpose of fostering entertainment, creativity, and connection through bite-sized, algorithmically-curated videos.  TikTok users have the ability to report videos that violate community standards.  These reports identify content that need to be reviewed by moderators.  This process generates a lot of reports that are not feasible for humans to review.  This project involves a human-in-the-loop approach to create a machine learning model capable of identifying whether a video presents a claim or expresses an opinion, enabling humans to focus solely on reviewing genuine claims.  With a successful model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.

**Note to Readers**:

As I progress through my capstone project, I have made the decision to transition from the TikTok dataset to the Automidata dataset for the remainder of my regression and machine learning work. While working with both the TikTok and Waze datasets, I realized they presented similar challenges and problem structures. To introduce a fresh set of analytical questions and new modeling opportunities, I have chosen Automidata, which is well-suited for continuous value prediction in regression modeling. This shift allows for deeper exploration of predictive techniques and provides a more diverse set of challenges to solve.

Thank you for following along—I'm excited to share the insights ahead!

### A Quick Look at Automitadata

Automidata is all about helping businesses make sense of their data and use it to drive smarter decisions. Whether it's building dashboards for better business insights or creating customer-facing tools, they specialize in turning raw data into meaningful solutions.

One of their key clients is the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the agency responsible for licensing and regulating taxis and for-hire vehicles across New York City. The TLC has partnered with Automidata to develop a regression model that accurately predicts taxi fares based on years of collected trip data. This project is a great opportunity to tackle real-world challenges in predictive modeling while improving fare estimations for both drivers and passengers.

This project is an incredible opportunity for us to collaborate with one of the largest clients in the state and contribute to a company that plays a vital role in serving the public. By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to ensure fair and accurate pricing for riders while supporting a service that directly impacts the daily lives of so many people.

## About the Company  

Salifort Motors data is based on a *fictional* French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer.  

Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. *(Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go.)* Salifort’s senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company.  

Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Additionally, the high turnover rate has significant financial implications. The company invests heavily in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees, making retention a key priority.  

If Salifort could predict whether an employee will leave the company and uncover the reasons behind their departure, leadership could better understand the problem and develop targeted solutions.  

### Independent Capstone Project  

In this independent capstone project, I took a self-directed approach to analyzing a real-world business problem with minimal instruction and guidance. From defining the problem to delivering actionable insights, I applied data-driven techniques to uncover key findings. My process included:  

- Gathering and synthesizing information related to a business problem or organizational inquiry  
- Writing Python code to answer relevant questions  
- Conducting exploratory data analysis  
- Building statistical and machine learning models  
- Evaluating ethical considerations related to the task  
- Presenting findings in a clear, stakeholder-friendly manner
