Capstone Project for Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certification Program

## Introduction

TikTok is a short-form video-sharing platform that empowers users ( aka "influencers") to create, discover, and share engaging content across diverse genres, with the primary purpose of fostering entertainment, creativity, and connection through bite-sized, algorithmically-curated videos.  TikTok users have the ability to report videos that violate community standards.  These reports identify content that need to be reviewed by moderators.  This process generates a lot of reports that are not feasible for humans to review.  This project involves a human-in-the-loop approach to create a machine learning model capable of identifying whether a video presents a claim or expresses an opinion, enabling humans to focus solely on reviewing genuine claims.  With a successful model, TikTok can reduce the backlog of user reports and prioritize them more efficiently.
